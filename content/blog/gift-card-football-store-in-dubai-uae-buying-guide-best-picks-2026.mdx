- **Terms**: What happens if the card isn't fully used?
- **Combination with sales**: Can gift cards be used during promotions?

### 4. Consider the Recipient

Think about their football interests:

- **Club affiliation**: Real Madrid fan, Premier League supporter, etc.
- **Playing level**: Professional, amateur, youth player
- **Current needs**: Do they need specific items like goalkeeper gloves or training gear?

## Best Gift Card Options in the UAE

### Premium Football Stores

**Official Retailers**: Authorized dealers offering authentic products from major brands.
